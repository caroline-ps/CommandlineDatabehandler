CommandLine Databehandler

Exercise number 1

//Context//
The interface defines the minimum required behaviour for my program. The class follows the interfaces rules and solves the problem. 
The program creates an instance of my class and uses it. 

//pseudo code//
1. Check that the class contains the same methods as the interface
2. In FileHandler.cs, inside ReadFIleContent() check if the datasett.json file exist. 
3. If the json file doesn't exist, write error message and exit the program. 
4. If the json file exists, write json content (no parsing).
5. In program.cs, create an instance of the class and call it to run the program.
